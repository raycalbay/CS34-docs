# CS34: Toolset Guide

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment and connect your projects to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the necessary software and accounts ready.

### Download tools

* **Visual Studio Code:** [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* **Git:** [Download here](https://git-scm.com/install/)

### Setup GitHub

* **Account:** Sign up at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
* **Repository:** Create a new repository on GitHub for your coursework. Copy the **HTTPS URL** of the repo.

## Local workspace setup

Create a dedicated folder to keep your docs/code organized.

1. Open **Windows Explorer** and navigate to `C:\`.
2. Create a new folder and name it `GIT`.

## Install VS Code Extensions

We will use **Git Graph** to help visualize your branches and commits.

1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Click the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for **Git Graph**.
4. Select **Install**. If prompted, select **Trust Publisher**.

## Clone your repository

This step downloads your GitHub project to your local `C:\GIT` folder.

1. In VS Code, open a **Git Bash** terminal (`Terminal` > `New Terminal`).
   * *Note: Ensure the dropdown in the terminal panel says "Git Bash" and not "PowerShell".*
2. Navigate to your GIT folder by typing:

   ```
   cd /c/GIT
    ```
3. Clone your repository:
    ```
    git clone [your-repo-URL]
    ```
4. Open the folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder > navigate to your repo).

## Publish main & create a dev branch

In this class, we follow a branching workflow. You must publish your **main** branch first, then create a **dev** branch for your work.

### Publish the main branch

You must commit a file to "activate" the main branch on GitHub.

1. Create a new file named `README.md` in your folder.
2. In the terminal, run:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Setup main branch"
    git push origin main
    ```

### Create and push the dev branch

Now, create a secondary branch where your actual development will happen.

1. Create and switch to the dev branch:

    ```
    git checkout -b dev
    ```

2. Open the folder: Go to File > Open Folder, navigate to C:\GIT, and select your repository folder. 

3. When prompted, click Yes, I trust the authors.

4. Push the new branch to GitHub:

    ```
    git push -u origin dev
    ```

### Verify working setup

Open the **Git Graph** view (click the Graph icon in the bottom status bar).

You should see both the main and dev branches.

Ensure the dev branch label is bold (indicating it is your active branch) before you begin working on your files.
